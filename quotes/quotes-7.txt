Charles Bukowski: “That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.”
Suzanne Collins: “You don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.”
Suzanne Collins: “Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.”
C.S. Lewis: “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”
J.R.R. Tolkien: “Not all those who wander are lost.”
J.K. Rowling: “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”
Ernest Hemingway: “There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.”
Ralph Waldo Emerson: “Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.”
Mark Twain: “I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.”
Dr. Seuss: “I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind. Some come from ahead and some come from behind. But I've bought a big bat. I'm all ready you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!”
